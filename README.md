### ml4a-guides

These guides accompany the chapters of [ml4a.github.io](http://ml4a.github.io), providing a series of pre-baked code samples, IPython notebooks, and markdown-based tutorials guiding the interested reader in how to practically work with some of the algorithms described by ml4a.

The homepage for these is [here](http://ml4a.github.io/guides), which contains an overview of the included guides and tutorials, as well as some additional (in-progress) materials to help you get setup.
